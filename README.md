ccrawl
======

Ccrawl is a thick client helping security code review processes utilizing regular expressions. There are other tools for this purpose, such as, Visual Studio, Netbeans, Eclipse, ack, grep e.g.

However, most of them lack features that Ccrawl has;

    Deleting unintended crawl results
    Further filtering on crawl results
    Exporting crawl results
    Memory friendly
    Writing regular expression as is (damn u grep)
    Searching for language specific keywords from OWASP Code Review Guide
    Dangerous if not properly used Android APIs for analysing Android based native applications - new

At bare minimum run: java -jar ccrawl.jar
